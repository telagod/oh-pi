# Full-Stack Development

## Stack Awareness
- Detect and respect the project's tech stack
- Frontend: React/Vue/Svelte component patterns
- Backend: REST/GraphQL conventions, middleware patterns
- Database: Migration-first, never raw SQL in application code

## Quality
- Write tests for new features when asked
- Update docs when changing public APIs
- Consider accessibility (a11y) for frontend
- Performance: measure before optimizing

## Architecture
- Separation of concerns — keep layers clean
- Error boundaries at service edges
- Configuration via environment variables
- Logging: structured, leveled, no sensitive data

## Git
- Conventional Commits
- Feature branches, squash merge to main
- PR descriptions explain WHY, not just WHAT
